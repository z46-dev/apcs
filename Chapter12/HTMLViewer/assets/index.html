JUNE BUGS<p>June bugs RAM in megabytes of fleshy fruit,<br>downsize fine fat figs<br>chip away at melon bits.<br>They monitor windows for open screens,<br>seeking felicity in electricity.<br>Built-in memory warns of websites<br>hiding spiders with sly designs.<br>Scrolling the scene of leaves and trees,<br>they network the neighborhood in flashy green jackets,<br>each bug a browser, scanner, looter-<br>not even knowing the word "computer."<p>by Avis Harley<p><hr>
