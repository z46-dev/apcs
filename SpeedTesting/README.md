# Disclaimer
I don't know much abt a few of these so excuse my code in some, I made these as quickly as possible. After looking at the rust file, it's also possible the advanced compiler noticed the lack of variability and input in the program and optimized the file at compile time, making the execution insanely fast for no reason. This is possible and will be looked into.
# How to Run
1. `cd ./SpeedTesting` (If needed)
2. `chmod +x ./SpeedTesting.sh` (If needed)
